Research Projects 
======

I have worked on several research projects supported by internal and external funds on

* Smart Energy Market and Data Analytics ( “Demand Response to the Rescue: Controlling the Uncertainty of Green Energy Resources” funded by University of Essex PVC (Research) Strategic Fund as Co-I, “A Distributed and Real-time Learning Framework for Smart Meter Big Data” funded by University of Essex PhD Studentship and “Distributed Auction Design for Smart Microgrids” funded by Durham Energy Institute, both as PI)

* Smart Grids and Sustainable Energy Systems (EPSRC funded projects “The Autonomic Power System”, “Energy Storage for Low Carbon Grids” and “Development and Evaluation of Sustainable Technologies for Flexible Operation of Conventional Power Plants”)

* Smart/Digital Buildings and Building Energy Management (ERDF funded project “Visual Building Fire Protection System” as PI, European Commission Horizon 2020 funded projects “TABEDE: TowArds Building rEady for Demand rEsponse” and “DRiVE: Demand Response Integration tEchnologies: unlocking the demand response potential in the distribution grid”)

* Smart Mobility (EPSRC funded project “Towards More Autonomy for Unmanned Vehicles: Situational Awareness and Decision Making under Uncertainty”)

* AI for Healthcare (“Non-intrusive residential energy monitoring for dementia” funded by ESRC IAA via University of Essex as PI).
